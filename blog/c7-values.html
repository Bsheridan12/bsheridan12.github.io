    For this week's cultural blog we were asked to think about our values and how we can use them to overcome stereotype threat and, in general, lead a more fulfilling and happy life.
    Out of the list we were given I have narrowed down the values that are most important to me and given them a ranking ( 1 = not important / 5 = very important ) 

    <ul>
      <li>Accomplishment - 4 </li>
      <li>Adventure - 3</li>
      <li>Challenge - 4</li>
      <li>Close Relationships -4 </li>
      <li>Efficiency - 5 </li>
      <li>Growth  - 5 </li>
      <li>Happiness - 4 </li>
      <li>Introspection - 5 </li>
      <li>Meaningful Work -4 </li>
      <li>Music - 5 </li>
      <li>Nature - 4 </li>
      <li>Persistence - 5 </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    I feel that most of these values are fairly commonly held by most people but I one that can often be overlooked is introspection. I have found that examining why I react, feel, or think a certain has really helped me improve a lot of my other values. Introspection has frequently helped me to grow, to improve and maintain close relationships, to be more confident (though there is still a long way to go) and to be more comfortable in my skin. In general introspection has helped me to understand and accept who I am and maintain my happiness. </p>

    <p> This week we were also asked to talk about the last time someone asked us for advice. I think the last topic I was asked about was relationship advice but the last time someone has asked my advice on a significant was when my friend, who has experienced rampant anxiety for the majority of her life, was trying to decide whether or not to begin taking medicine that could help  her to manage it but could have some less than ideal side effects. In such a situation it is difficult to give advice and often I find that people really aren't looking for it, rather they are just looking for someone to talk it out with in order to better process the options. In this case we did talk about it for a good while on several different occasions and I think that she is happy with her decision. </p>

    <p> I feel that my values will be important to me and my success while at DBC and of course through out life. When I get stressed out or start getting down on myself I will need to remember that with persistence I WILL get through this and I will do well. Music will also be hugely important to my sanity as it always has been for me so when I'm feeling down I will tune out of the world for a while to recoup. </p>
