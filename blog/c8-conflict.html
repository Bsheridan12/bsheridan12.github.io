    <p> A relatively large conflict that I have had this past year was with my roommate at the time. We had recently moved in together as a kind of spur of the moment thing. We were good friends and both needed a place in the same part of town so it seemed like a no brainer. After just a couple days I realized quickly that I had made a mistake for several reasons. In the interest of brevity I will talk 
    about only one of the many conflicts we had. </p>

    <p> She had just adopted an untrained and fairly young basenji, a dog breed that, unbeknownst to me at the time, is know for their distinctive piercing bark and their untethered energy. At the time she was taking a full load of classes at the University of Arizona and when she wasn't studying was frequently out with friends leaving me, more often than not, alone to endure and take care of her rowdy dog; something I was less than pleased about. </p>

    <p> It saddened me to see such a loving and adorable creature treated so flippantly by her owner but I understood she was busy and so I did my best to help take care of Charlie for a time. I was never asked to do so but being the only person home with a neglected and hungry dog, morally I saw no other choice. I quickly became her primary caregiver though and I started to feel that she had no regard for my time and no appreciation for the amount of effort I had to put into looking after her pet. </p>

    <p> I approached my roommate a couple times asking if she could try and make more time for her dog so that the responsibility didn't fall to my shoulders by default but there was never much of a change. I'm certain there were things that I could have done better to try and handle my situation but I felt trapped and there were other issues that we had begun to butt heads over. At a point I began to feel as though she was neglecting her responsibilities with her dog out of passive/aggressive spite for me. I began to react passive/aggressively as well and our problems escalated. After about two and half months of living together we ended up breaking our lease and moving out.</p> 

    <p>If I could go back I would have done more to calmly convey to her how disrespected I felt and I would have done so as soon as I started to feel that way instead of allowing myself to be walked all over for a month as my anger built. </p>

    <p> I think what I learned from this experience really was that, when living with someone, I have to be sure to be very vocal when I begin to feel disrespected or taken advantage of and encourage them to do the same. </p>
