    Version control is is useful because it supplies you with a clear and orderly way to go back and review any changes you have made to your program along the way and allows you to easily revert back to an earlier version of that code should the need arise.

    Git helps you keep track of your changes because rather than overwriting the old file every time you save, git takes an independent snapshot of the changes that you've just made. Git then adds that snapshot to an index that is saved locally on your machine. This index is easily searchable by using '$ git log' to see a list of all of the changes that have been made to that repository or '$git log --grep' to search for specific keywords or strings. In addition to making the different version easily searchable git will also highlight the lines that have been added or removed as well as the specific changes on those lines and allows you to add comments about the changes for your own and other's benefits when reviewing the changes in the future. 

    GitHub is a great place to store your code at very least because it acts as a backup so you can access your projects from any machine and you never have to worry about losing your work if your hard drive becomes unrecoverable. However, GitHub is so much more than that.It is a whole community of developers where you can get feedback on your code and collaborate with others on projects at the same time without having to worry about overwriting anyone else's work.
