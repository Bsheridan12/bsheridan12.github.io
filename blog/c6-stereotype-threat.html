    Every culture, race, nation, sexual orientation, gender, age, religion etc., has their own slew of negative stereotypes but until it was brought into the light for me at Dev Bootcamp I never really had a notion of how insidious stereotype threat can be. 
    <p>
    Stereotype threat is described as the phenomena that happens when one feels that, through their performance, either academically or physically, they may perpetuate or confirm a stereotype associated with their identity. It has been shown that when one faces this pressure while taking tests it often serves to distract or stress a given person which in turn causes a drop in performance that is not seen when stereotype threat is removed from the equation. This causes a vicious cycles and perpetrates stereotypes both to those being subject to them and to those observing the results.</p>
    <p>
    Though I have been subject to a few stereotypes I can't claim I have ever felt disparaged by any, and after reading so much about how significantly this effects so many people my experiences seems rather irrelevant. However, since I have been prompted to, I will mention a couple. I think the times that I feel it the most is when I find myself in a discussion that has been sensationalized to be about race or sexism but may have many more facets that are often overlooked. Generally in these discussions I immediately (and correctly) assume that I have far less experience with the topic and tend to take a more passive stance listening to the discussion. However on the occasion that I do point out that this issue is not so one dimensional, I often feel that my opinion, whatever it may be, is either rendered inert because I am a white male, or I am labeled as a racist, sexist, supremacist; the enemy. Certainly this is not always the case but it has happened frequently enough for me to chose not to get involved. In this situation I don't feel like there would be any winning in me getting involved and facing the stereotype threat. They have made up their mind to believe what they believe and I would only get roped into a shouting match so instead I listen or walk away. In less extreme examples when I do chose to participate in the discussion I just need to be careful to clearly express my sentiment and not step on any toes. </p>
    <p> 
    Now that I have an understanding of what stereotype threat is I feel I will be able to more effectively identify when I am feeling it and when others in my group are feeling it as well. I think a great way to curb this threat is to discuss, in a group, our experience with the material or the test. This way everyone can see that they were not the only ones who felt a certain way making them feel that any given social identity has far less to do with their current experience. </p>
