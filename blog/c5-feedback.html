    Pairing has consistently been both a lot of fun for me as well as hugely beneficial though in a few cases after a pairing session I have found myself wanting. <br>
    I really like being able to discuss ideas with people who have different thinking and problem solve styles from me. I've found that often together we are able to complete challenges much faster than I would on my own and also produce far more efficient solutions. It is always ideal when my pair and I have similar understanding and competencies with the material we are working on but I also enjoy situations where I might be a bit more fluent than they. It grants me the opportunity to try and teach and explain which in turn helps me further solidify my understanding. I also find that in that situation they ask really insightful questions that I may not have ever thought of before and together we work to find the answer. A big source of stress for me during pairing has been when my pair has a much better understanding of the material than I do. This has only happened a couple times and in one instance my pair identified it and took more of a backseat role, allowing me to work through the problem on my own while supplying me with helpful tips and guidance for which I was greatly appreciative. When working through problems I tend to need to run the program and tinker with it and see the output and errors to really get a handle of whats going on. In the other couple instances that I have worked with someone more fluent than I, I felt very rushed and was not able to go through this method of trial and error before they supplied me with the answer which I think cased me to miss out on a lot of learning. I don't know if this pressure was from them or if it was self inflicted but either way it kind of caused me to seize up and left me unable to think effectively. This is something I need to work on and I think the first step is really just letting my pair know that this is an issue for me. I often worry though that I'm holding them back or frustrating them so even asking them to slow down or let me work something out own can be stressful for me so I guess another strategy  would be to not go blind into the challenge. If I allow myself some time before hand to review the problem and starting thinking about it that may help me keep up with someone who has greater skills than I do.

    <p> For the most part I have felt pretty good reading through the feedback I have received, though there was the occasion twinge of guild or embarrassment. A couple times people have stated that I could be better and communicating or that they didn't really like when I was developing code outside of stypi. That goes back to me need to test every little piece of code to see the output so I don't know that I will be able to stop doing that but I will let them know that I do this at the start as well as be more vocal about what I am doing and why when I start working in sublime instead.<br>
    Writing feedback has been a bit tricky for me. On a rare occasion I have had something specific for someone to improve on but for the most part every session has gone really well so I end up just saying something like, hey you were great at ____ keep doing what you're doing! I suppose this is specific and, in a way, actionable but I don't know it is the most helpful. After writing a few pieces of feedback though I have started to be more attentive to what works, what doesn't work, and what frustrates me and since then I have started to improve, I feel, in my feedback.</p>
