Kitchen vs. Table

The Culture of Dev Bootcamp

10/30/14

My education started at a Montessori school in my home town of Tucson, Arizona. Montessori schools have a reputation for employing a rather atypical curriculum by facilitating self and group motivated learning, building a strong community, cultivating creativity, as well as personal and emotional growth. I thrived in this environment and until I got to public high school I love learning. From what I can tell there are more than a few parallels between Hermosa and DBC and I am thrilled by this. I'm already extremely excited to learn programming but being immersed in that kind of environment I know I will be able to give it my all and love doing so. That being said I am of course still very nervous. DBC promises to be one of the greatest challenges I have faced but I have no doubt I will rise to the occasion.
