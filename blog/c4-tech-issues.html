    For all the advancements and progress that technology has effected there are still a good number of obstacles facing the technology world that it has yet been able to hurdle. The first one that probably comes to mind for most people is it's immense lack of diversity. The industry is dominated by straight white men. This is a very important issue for a lot of reasons and is likely the biggest issue the tech industry faces. For that reason, it is likely going to be the most talked about issue in these blogs so, for the sake of diversity within our community, I'm going to talk about something else. 
    <p>
    Another issue that looms over the tech industry is the matter of net neutrality and government intervention in general. Net neutrality is the ideal that all data on the internet should be treated equally. This principal has been a huge contribute to the rapid progress and innovation within the tech world. The internet has nearly obliterated the bar for entry for so many types of companies, both logistically and financially, while also expanding their potential customer base. This has lead to the risk of throwing a product, service, or idea out into the world being drastically decreased and as a result we have seen so many amazing start ups become, what many would now consider, integral installments in their daily life. Thanks to the level playing field that the internet has created we have Netflix, Amazon, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube just to list a very few. Often these start ups expand beyond their initial niche with incredible results. Thanks to Google self diving cars are already a reality and will be common place in the near future and will revolutionize the entire transportation industry. Many YouTube creators have chosen to focus on education and as a result are supplying teachers around the world with education materials that are fun and engaging for their students.</p>
    <p>
    In a world where we allow ISP's and governments to dictate what content shows up where on the web, establish 'slow lanes' as a way to strangle their competition, or censor sites that express divergent opinions, we may have never seen a lot of the innovation that we enjoy today. Sure, it's not hard to imagine that the ISP's would have created a similar alternatives but they would likely show as much imagination, long term investment, and quality consciousness as the current major ISP's in the US do, and anyone who has ever called Comcast for any reason can tell you that is not a desirable outcome. </p>
    <p>
    The most immediate to ensure net neutrality is for our governments to write it into law. Until then we need to keep spreading the awareness on this issue and fighting any legislation that threatens to ruin this great level playing field we have managed to create. </p>
