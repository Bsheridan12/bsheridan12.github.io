    It seems that throughout or lives we are consistently labeled and categorized in order to better understand each other as well as ourselves and how we interact with the world. 
    Going through school I have taken a wide array of tests aimed at determining my learning styles and personality types. I had, however, never before encountered the <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm">Gregorc Thinking Styles</a> until DBC and it piqued my interest. I do believe that the majority of these studies into thinking/learning styles and personality types are based off of legitimate science but I also feel that there is some element of what I'll call astrological science; sufficiently broad or vague statements that each individual reader can scan their lives for and apply in a way that they most agree with.
    <p>
    These thinking styles are broken down into two main groups: your perceptual quality, either concrete or abstract, and your ordering ability, either sequential or random.  Upon taking <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">The Quiz</a> I learned that I predominately an abstract sequential thinker with abstract random in a fairly close second. According to Dr. Gregorc this means that I logical and analytic and a good problem solver but I'm not the fastest worker/learner as a lot of my understanding comes from reflection. I like to work alone but I am also like to maintain good relationships with the people around me. In group situations I am very diplomatic and can be a uniting factor when there is tension. I like to debate and discuss and, though I prefer to listen, in debates I can begin to monopolize the conversation. When learning something new, I like to be able to ask an established expert a lot of questions to make sure I have a thorough understanding so that I do not build future knowledge on an unstable foundation.</p>

    So far in DBC my biggest struggle so far, since we have been going over pretty simple/review material, has been with pairing. I have worked well with everyone and all the sessions have gone smoothly but I found that in two cases when I work with people who have already finished the second or have had more time to thinking about it I wasn't given the chance to test my initial solution and then revise it and I feel that is critical to the way I learn even though this trial-and-error method is more characteristic of a concrete random thinker. I don't imagine that as we progress to more difficult material this will be as much of an issue for me but I think a good solution would be to give myself some time to review the questions and think on them for some time before I pair with someone else. </p>
    <p>
    I think another weakness I will have is spending too much time on one thing. Sometimes, especially with writing and creative things like the design for my site, I will spend an hour or more reading, looking at other's designs, and thinking about how to start and what I want to say. This is particularly true now since I have a relative abundance of time, a luxury I know I will not have when I get to DBC so time management is a skill I need to start developing now. I know time-boxing can help with this but not entirely a solution to me because even if I allot myself 25 minutes for prep work by the end of that I likely will still not be ready to start writing or designing so I will have to find other strategies as well. </p>
    <p>
    Regardless of the potential solutions I have to my weakness right now the most important thing is that I am aware of both them and my strengths so that as I work I am constantly thinking about how I can tailor my environment to better suit me.</p>
