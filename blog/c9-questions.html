    In general I would say that I am fairly good at asking questions, though I could be better. While researching the topic I found a lot of recommendations to include a good amount of context on the problem, what you have tried so far, as well as the end goal of the program you are working on; all things that I have been doing. A few recommendations that I had not been effectively employing though are to use short, descriptive titles and to only include the relevant snippets of code rather than the whole program. 

    Context is important to include because though you have a good understanding of the problem the people that will be trying to help you do not and will not be able to give you the support you need without it. Including what you have tried so far is also important because if someone knows what you have tried they can give you feedback on why they might not have been effective solutions or how you could get a working solution using one of your previous approaches. It also shows those answering questions that you have put a good amount of effort into solving your problem yourself and makes them more likely to help you since they can see that you are clearly not just looking for a quick answer and an easy way out. Lastly, supplying the overall goal of your program can be very useful because there are so many different methods to solve one problem, if someone knows your end goal they may be able to point you to a more effective or easier method rather than helping you solve the problem the long way round. 

    I've never really been required to use titles in my questions but it makes sense to put them in there regardless. When browsing unanswered questions people don't want to have to read the whole paragraph just to figure out if your problem is something that that can or want to help with so a short but descriptive title that outlines your issue is a great way to attract attention on forums rather than something like "Help!" Also, when posting questions in the past I have either not included all relevant code or I have posted my entire program. I attribute this to being very new with coding and not being able to isolate the problem I was having. I feel confident that were I to post a question that included some code now I would not have an issue doing so but it is still a good thing to keep in mind.
